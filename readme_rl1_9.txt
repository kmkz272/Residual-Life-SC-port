1. Why/description
This is a full port/conversion of Residual Life 1.9 (Half-Life mod) to sven coop.
i aim to keep most of the content of the original mod. You are free to report bugs or 
suggest changes if you want but bear in mind i am using months of my free time to do 
this as a hobby and for the challenge, not to satisfy the whims of users and server 
owners.

2. Important Notes 

(empty)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Changes made from the original mod
You can pick the desert eagle in a secret area. This weapon was not implemented in the
original mod but i added it anyway. 
Get the secrets on the first time on a map or you will be locked of doing it later.
To get the second cell area you need to get the first one and find the first 2 secrets.
The Sun eater Pillar chapter have some simplified paths to avoid going forward and back
too much times.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Known issues
There are some minor issues. I hope this is far better than the prior versions, anyway 
i plan to keep updating to polish and add new stuff.  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Quality Standars

I try to have the maps series without bugs and i have been maintaining and improving 
them in the last 3 years but is no easy task. Unlike other people i do not have
a public server or a team to make a test so i have to do that alone. this mean that 
i may miss problems that can only be seen when 2 or more players play the maps, now i
added bots in my tests and i hope to improve the results. Worth saying that most of the
ports i played (before 2019) had serious bugs and no one cares about it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Bug Reporting

It would help me if you find a problem and you report it to me but please check you
are reporting a REAL problem. I have been active on scmapdb and discord for long time,
i will read messages sent to me but i may not answer because i am tired of the bad side
of the community. Avoid making reports based only on resguy/w00tguy repacker script.
I check it frequently enough so i am sure the bug reports generated by these tools will
not be a problem. I notice some people are making this kind of reports without caring 
about real issues and i am starting to believe they are just trolling.

7. Download site

https://github.com/kmkz272/

I am using github to store my Sven Co-op ports and scripts since is far better than 
scmapdb, and so i am not using it anymore. This site has has been going downhill 
in the last years and is not a safe place for mappers to upload their maps since the 
incopetent administrators have been pushing and even forcing changes on other users 
maps based on their personal preferences, often making false reports in hope to gain 
some kind of legitimacy to push their changes as a way to feel they are somehow 
supporting the community since they are unwilling to keep themselves on their own 
projects and make their own maps. Please, do not upload this to scmapdb.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. Survival

I do not support survival mode, i am not interested. Over the years there have been 
many signs from the devs that they are not willing to properly maintain this feature.  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9. Custom versions

Avoid making custom versions of this pack. While i have been open to this some time ago
some people have been disrespecfully doing random changes on maps from the cummunity on 
scmapdb, making false bug reports and that kind of crap. So, until the enviroment get 
more healthy do not upload custom versions.
My DL site is https://github.com/kmkz272/ .If you find custom versions elsewhere these
are not mine and may have changes forced against my will.
