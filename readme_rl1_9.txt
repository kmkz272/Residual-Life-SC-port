1. Why/description
This is a full port/conversion of Residual Life 1.9 (Half-Life mod) to sven coop.
i aim to keep most of the content of the original mod. You are free to report bugs or 
suggest changes if you want but bear in mind i am using months of my free time to do 
this as a hobby and for the challenge, not to satisfy the whims of users and server 
owners.

2. Important Notes

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Changes made from the original mod
You can pick the desert eagle in a secret area. This weapon was not implemented in the
original mod but i added it anyway. 
Get the secrets on the first time on a map or you will be locked of doing it later.
To get the second cell area you need to get the first one and find the first 2 secrets.
The Sun eater Pillar chapter have some simplified paths to avoid going forward and back
too much times.

4. Known issues
There are some minor issues. I hope this is far better than the prior versions, anyway 
i plan to keep updating to polish and add new stuff.  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Quality Standars

I try to have the maps series without bugs and i have been maintaining and improving 
them in the last 3 years but is no easy task. Unlike other people i do not have
a public server or a team to make a test so i have to do that alone. this mean that 
i may miss problems that can only be seen when 2 or more players play the maps, now i
added bots in my tests and i hope to improve the results. Worth saying that most of the
ports i played (before 2019) had serious bugs and no one cares about it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Bug Reporting

It would help me if you find a problem and you report it to me but please check you
are reporting a REAL problem. I have been active on scmapdb and discord for long time,
i will read messages sent to me but i may not answer because i am tired of the bad side
of the community. Avoid making reports based only on resguy/w00tguy repacker script.
I check it frequently enough so i am sure the bug reports generated by these tools will
not be a problem. I notice some people are making this kind of reports without caring 
about real issues and i am starting to believe they are just trolling.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. Download site

For now i am using scmapdb.com to store my Sven Co-op maps/ports. This site has has been 
going downhill in the last years and is not a safe place for mappers to upload their 
maps since there are clear signs that the administrators may attempt to force random 
modifications over the maps hidden under the questionable "fixed" tag. Sadly this site 
has no alternative but i will try to find one.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. Survival

survival mode is not supported. I am not interested in this poorly maintained feature.
